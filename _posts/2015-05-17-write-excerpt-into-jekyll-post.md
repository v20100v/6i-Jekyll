# How to do add an excerpt into post ?

You can access a snippet of a postsâ€™s content by using excerpt variable on a post. By default this is the first paragraph of content in the post, however it can be customized by setting a excerpt_separator variable in front matter or `_config.yml`.

By default, we choose to configure all posts with this excerpt separator :

```yaml
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
```

So we don't need to put it in front matter.
